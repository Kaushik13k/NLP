By default, the matcher will only return the matches and not do anything else, 
like merge entities or assign labels. This is all up to you and can be defined individually for each pattern, 
by passing in a callback function as the on_match argument on add(). This is useful, 
because it lets you write entirely custom and pattern-specific logic. For example, 
you might want to merge some patterns into one token, while adding entity labels for other pattern types. 
You shouldnâ€™t have to create different matchers for each of those processes
